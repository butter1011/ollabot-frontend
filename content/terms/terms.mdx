Customers may choose to use these Third-Party Services in conjunction with our Service. If integration of the Service with a Third-Party Service is required, Customers must provide their login information to Ollabot solely for the purpose of allowing Ollabot to provide its Service. Ollabot does not endorse any Third-Party Service and is not responsible for any issues arising from their use.

## 8. Financial Terms

Customers must pay for access and use of the Service as detailed in the applicable Order ("Fees").

This agreement takes effect on the first day of the Subscription Period and remains in effect for the duration of the Subscription Period indicated in the Order, including renewals and any period during which the Customer uses the Service, even if that use is not under a paid Order ("Term"). If this agreement is terminated by either party, it will automatically terminate all Orders.

## 11. Modifications

Ollabot reserves the right to unilaterally modify the terms of this agreement, provided that Customers are notified at least thirty (30) days before such modifications take effect, with modifications posted prominently, for example, on the terms page of the Ollabot website.

## 12. General Provisions
