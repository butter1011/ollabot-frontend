## Step 1: Initialize Your Ollabot Chatbot

First, log into your Ollabot account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for free. After logging in, create your chatbot by uploading the necessary data sources. These can include documents, text snippets, websites, or question-and-answer pairs that will serve as the knowledge base for your chatbot.

For a detailed guide on setting up and deploying your Ollabot chatbot, refer to this step-by-step tutorial.

## Step 2: Generate and Copy Your Ollabot Chatbot Embed Code

1. Each chatbot created on Ollabot has a unique embed code for integration. Once your chatbot is set up on Ollabot, navigate to your Dashboard page and select the specific bot you want to integrate with your Bubble application.
