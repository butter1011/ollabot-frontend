## Step 1: Sign Into Your Ollabot Account and Set up your Bot

To embed your Ollabot bot into your Weebly website, first sign in to your Ollabot account. If you don't have an account yet, you can create one for free. Once signed in, you can set up your bot in Ollabot by uploading data sources like files, text snippets, websites, or Q&A pairs that the bot can learn from. Here is a step-by-step guide for setting up your Ollabot chatbot.


## Step 2: Generate and Copy Your Ollabot Chatbot Embed Code

1. Each chatbot created on Ollabot has a unique embed code for integration. Once your chatbot is set up on Ollabot, navigate to your Dashboard page and select the specific bot you want to integrate with your Bubble application.

2. Clicking on the bot will take you to its preview page. From there, go to the "Embed on Site" tab, and click the "Make Public" button.

3. A pop-up window will appear with the provided HTML code. Click "Copy Script" to copy the code snippet.

To add a Ollabot chatbot to your Weebly website:

4. Drag the "Embed Code" element to wherever you want your chatbot to appear on the page.

5. You should then see a text element that says "Click to set custom HTML" where the Embed code widget was placed. Click on the text, and then click on "Edit Custom HTML".

6. Paste your Ollabot embed code into the custom HTML box.
