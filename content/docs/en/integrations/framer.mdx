## Step 1: Set Up Your Ollabot Chatbot

To integrate your Ollabot AI chatbot into your Bubble application, start by logging into your Ollabot account. If you don't have an account yet, you can sign up for free. After logging in, configure your bot within the Ollabot platform by uploading relevant data sources such as files, text snippets, websites, or question-and-answer pairs to build the chatbot's knowledge base.

Follow this step-by-step roadmap for suaccessfully deploying your Ollabot chatbot.

## Step 2: Generate and Copy Your Ollabot Chatbot Embed Code

1. Each chatbot created on Ollabot has a unique embed code for integration. Once your chatbot is set up on Ollabot, navigate to your Dashboard page and select the specific bot you want to integrate with your Bubble application.
