## Generate your own API Key

The first thing you have to do to access Ollabot API, is by generating your own API Key. You can generate your API Key by following the steps here: [Generate API Key](https://app.ollabot.com/docs/api).


**Delete API Guide**

The Chatbot Deletion API allows you to delete an existing chatbot by making a DELETE request to the `/api/v1/delete-chatbot` endpoint.

## Endpoint

**DELETE** https://app.ollabot.com/api/v1/delete-chatbot

## Request Headers

The API request must include the following headers:

- **Authorization**: Bearer `<Your-Secret-Key>` - The secret key for authenticating the API request.
- **Content-Type**: application/json - The content type of the request payload.

## Request Body

The request body should contain the following parameter:

- **botId** (string, required): The unique identifier of the chatbot to be deleted.

### Example Request

#### JavaScript

```javascript
const res = await fetch('https://app.ollabot.com/api/v1/delete-chatbot', {
  method: 'DELETE',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer <Your-Secret-Key>`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    botId: 'exampleId-123'
  })
});

const data = await res.json();

console.log(data); // { message: 'Chatbot deleted successfully' }
```

#### Python

```python
import requests

url = 'https://app.ollabot.com/api/v1/delete-chatbot'
headers = {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <Your-Secret-Key>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
data = {
    'botId': 'exampleId-123'
}

response = requests.delete(url, json=data, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

#### Shell

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://app.ollabot.com/api/v1/delete-chatbot \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <Your-Secret-Key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"botId": "exampleId-123"}'
```

## Response

The API response will be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "message": "Chatbot deleted successfully"
}
```

## Error Handling

If there are any errors during the API request, appropriate HTTP status codes will be returned along with error messages in the response body. Make sure to handle these errors gracefully in your application.
