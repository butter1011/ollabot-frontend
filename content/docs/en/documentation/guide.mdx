### Company Name

Enter the name of your company. This will be displayed in the chat window to help users identify the organization behind the chatbot.

### Description

Provide a brief overview of what your chatbot can do. This description will help users understand the bot's purpose and capabilities.

## Step 4: Customize the Chatbox

### Company Logo

You can upload a company logo to be displayed in the chat window. The logo helps in branding and gives users a visual identifier of your company.

Upload an avatar image that represents the chatbot. This can be an image that fits the bot's personality.

### Chat Bubble Icon

Choose a chat bubble icon from the available options to match your brand's style.

### Accent Color

## Step 5: Add Knowledge Sources

### Upload Files

You can upload files that contain information your bot needs to know. This can include PDFs, text files, and more. Navigate to the "Knowledge Base" section and click "Upload Files."
